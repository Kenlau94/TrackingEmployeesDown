# SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker

## Task

This assignment is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This lesson seemed fun and easy at first but proved difficult. I was stuck on this code for about 2 weeks but through grit, chat gtp and my fellow classmates I figured out the bugs and learned a cool new program called acsii. Much apreciation for the help to power through the challenges and to even break down the bonus, which seemed imposible at first.

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- WHEN I start the application
- THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
- WHEN I choose to view all departments
- THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
- WHEN I choose to view all roles
- THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
- WHEN I choose to view all employees
- THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
- WHEN I choose to add a department
- THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
- WHEN I choose to add a role
- THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
- WHEN I choose to add an employee
- THEN I am prompted to enter the employee’s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
- WHEN I choose to update an employee role
- THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database
