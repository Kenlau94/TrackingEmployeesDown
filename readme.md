# SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker

## Task

This assignment is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This lesson seemed fun and easy at first but proved difficult. I was stuck on this code for about 2 weeks but through grit, chat gtp and my fellow classmates I figured out the bugs and learned a cool new program called acsii. Much apreciation for the help to power through the challenges and to even break down the bonus, which seemed imposible at first.

## Acceptance Criteria

-GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
-WHEN I start the application
-THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
-WHEN I choose to view all departments
-THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
-WHEN I choose to view all roles
-THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
-WHEN I choose to view all employees
-THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
-WHEN I choose to add a department
-THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
-WHEN I choose to add a role
